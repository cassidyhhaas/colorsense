"""Shared prune/renormalize/argmax-fallback step for probability rankings.

Every palette ranking stage ends the same way: normalize raw prominence weights into a
probability distribution, prune entries below a minimum share, renormalize the
survivors, and — if pruning would empty a non-empty input — keep the single argmax at
probability 1.0 instead. This module implements that step once, so the two call sites
(``palette/usage.py``, ``palette/reconcile.py``) cannot drift:
every argmax fallback breaks exact-probability ties by the caller-supplied ``tie_key``
— the color ``hex`` at all call sites, smallest winning, which is the codebase's
determinism convention.

``classify/components.py`` has a similar-looking softmax-prune block but ranks
``ComponentType`` keys, not colors — there is no hex to tie-break on, and ``classify/``
does not depend on ``palette/`` — so it deliberately keeps a local copy (with a pointer
back here).

    ``items`` and ``weights`` are parallel; the result is ``(item, probability)`` pairs
    in input order (callers apply their own final ranking sort). Degenerate cases keep
    a single deterministic argmax at probability 1.0 rather than emptying a non-empty
    input:

    * pruning removed everything → the highest-probability item wins, exact ties broken
      by the smallest ``tie_key``;
    * the weights sum to zero (e.g. an all-zero-area surface set) → every item ties, so
      the smallest ``tie_key`` wins outright.

    ``protected`` (optional, parallel to ``items``) marks entries that survive the
    share prune regardless of their share — the caller has independent absolute evidence
    that they belong (e.g. a minimum raw vote mass), so they must not be diluted out when
    a role accumulates many entries. They renormalize alongside the share survivors. A
    protected entry still cannot resurrect a zero-total input (the argmax fallback owns
    that case). An empty ``items`` yields ``[]``.
